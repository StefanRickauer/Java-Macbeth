# Java-Macbeth
A simple Compiler.

In order to learn more about compilers and how they work I decided to implement one. Therefore, I work through the book "Programming Language Processors in Java"
by David A Watt and Deryck F Brown where a lot of the source code comes from. However, I decided to deviate from the source material by adding unit tests, rename
identifiers, rearrange fields and methods (in some cases), use different keywords and reduce the complexity of the programming language. The result is supposed 
to be a very basic programming language, without control structures (conditional statements or loops), two supported data types (number and string) and one 
build in function (show).
